The first attempt at packaging the emacs n-gram completer.

Must be installed to ~/projects/ngram-complete-dist

Currently hardcoded for java

Require a modified version of MITLM https://github.com/abramhindle/MIT-Language-Modeling-Toolkit

put into ~/projects/mitlm 


== Installation

Get jzmq http://www.zeromq.org/bindings:java
	git clone https://github.com/zeromq/jzmq.git
	cd jzmq
	autogen.sh
	./configure
	make
	sudo make install

Get modified mitlm  https://github.com/abramhindle/MIT-Language-Modeling-Toolkit
	git clone  https://github.com/abramhindle/MIT-Language-Modeling-Toolkit.git mitlm
	cd mitlm
	./autogen.sh
	make
	
get antlr3
	sudo apt-get install antlr3

build antlr stuff
	cd ngram-complete-dist/antlr
	make

install perl reqs:
	sudo aptitude install  libmoosex-singleton-perl  libmoosex-yaml-perl  libmoose-perl  libany-moose-perl  libmoose-autobox-perl libzeromq-perl

== Running	

	cd ngram-complete-dist/emacs
	make run-java-lexer
	perl ngram-completer -server 1
