********** ABOUT ***************************************************************

    UnnaturalCode is a system with the purpose of augmenting the compiler's own
syntax error location strategies. It is designed to assist the developer in
locating syntax errors in their software. For more information, please consult
the current draft of the UnnaturalCode paper (on submission) at:

    http://webdocs.cs.ualberta.ca/~joshua2/syntax.pdf
